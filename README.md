Here is the code for the analysis of 'Effectiveness of primary HPV-based cervical screening among older women: Long-term follow-up of a randomised healthcare policy trial on exit testing'. 
I have already deleted all the identifying information in the code. You need to apply for access of the exact same datasets mentioned in the code from www.nkcx.se first to make the code run properly.
The code can be read and run with SAS, you can also open it with any text reader.
